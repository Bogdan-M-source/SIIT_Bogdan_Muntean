                The American Bully is a small to large breed, which has been divided into four categories by some registering
                organizations, including Pocket, Standard, Classic, and XL.<br>
                The American Bully is a highly adaptable and trainable breed, often acting as a loving companion. Many dogs, despite
                acting as lapdogs in the home, do well in sports such as weight pull and flirt pole. Dog and human aggression is
                discouraged in breed standards.
