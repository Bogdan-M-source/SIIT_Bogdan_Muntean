        German Sheperd<br>
        German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for
        males, and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females.<br> German Shepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal
        proportion of 10 to 8+1⁄2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range. They have a domed
        forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are
        large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement.<br> A German Shepherd
        has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is
        bushy and reaches to the hock.
